                    <p>
                        The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

    <!--Within the the element I have three self-contained "articles" that bring together the three different benefits we have listed on the webpage.-->
    <!--This keeps the code looking clean so that if you ever needed to change something in one of the articles you could just navigate to the section and then whichever article you need-->
