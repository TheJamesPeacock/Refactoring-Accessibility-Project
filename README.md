# Refactoring-Accessibility-Project
 
My motivation to build this project was to refactor some given code to make it look cleaner. Thus allowing anyone the ability to read it and know what is going on very clearly.

I built this project to hone my skills at organization, functionality, and becoming better at making webpages more accessible for all people.
Completing this project solved the problem of our webpage not being accessible, the code to the website being unorganized and an eyesore, and some functions of the website were just not working outright.

I learned how and when to use new HTML scemantics that I found, things like, article, main, and aside to name a few. I learned to be patient and pay attention to the little details in code cause sometimes your biggest problems require the simplest solutions. For example, I was stressing out over my header being pushed so far to the right and no matter what I seemed to do nothing would fix it, and google was letting me down. So I gave up, but I came back a few hours later and looked at things very closely testing every little thing again, and in the end it turns out I had one of my CSS attributes in the wrong spot in my header.

I think the thing that makes my project stand out is my HTML organization, I feel like I personally did a really good job at that aspect of this project and I was very proud of myself when I finished considering I was running into a lot of issues when I was working through the project.
